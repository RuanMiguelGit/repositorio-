    <h2> Fatos sobre o Stomatopoda</h2>

    <p> Eyes are testaments to evolution’s creativity. They all do the same basic things—detect 
        light, and convert it into electrical signals—but in such a wondrous 
        variety of ways. There are single and compound eyes, bifocal lenses and rocky ones, 
        irrors and optic fibres. And there are eyes that are so alien, so constantly surprising,
         that after decades of research, scientists have only just about figured out how they work, 
         let alone why they evolved that way. To find them, you need to go for a swim.

    <p> Most people have three types of light-detecting cells, or photoreceptors, 
        which are sensitive to red, green and blue light. But the mantis shrimp has anywhere from 12 to 16 different photoreceptorsin
        its midband.Most people assume that they must therefore
         be really good at seeing a wide range of colours—a “thermonuclear bomb of light and beauty”, as the Oatmeal put it. But last year, 
         Hanna Thoen from the University of Queensland found that they’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at 
         discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at discriminating between coloursthey’re much worse at 
         discriminating between colours than most other animals! They seem to use their dozen-plus receptors to recognise colours in a unique 
         way that’s very different to other animals but oddly similar to some satellites.
